Tool for Complex and Scalable Data Access Policy Enforcement\nPalisade aims to provide a stable framework for defining and enforcing policies for accessing data.\nIntroduction\nModern organisations can have multiple datasets that are each managed and accessed according to different policies and procedures.\nThis can make it complicated for analysis while still ensuring regulatory compliance.\nMost technologies \"out of the box\" do not provide the necessary solution for managing these complex issues for data access.\nThis leads to access to data being overly restrictive with potential insights from data being lost.\nPalisade can provide a solution to this problem; It consists of a set of services for enforcing complex data access policies across different datasets and platforms.\nThese services are able to provide modular data access controllers and independent peripheral services to allow policies to be integral to the process a client uses to access data.\nConsider the example of a set of datasets may have been assembled for specific purposes.\nFor a given dataset, only particular types of query are permitted for certain types of user.\nAlso, within each dataset a specific user may only be permitted to access a particular subset of the records.\nPalisade allows the policies for accessing datasets, redacting records and executing the query to be specified independently of the physical data and the platform hosting the data.\nThis will enable the clients to perform queries across the datasets while still conforming to company and regulatory policies.  \nPolicies are set per resource and are not changed by the user or context.\nHowever, the policies can use the information about the user and context to decide how the data needs to be sanitised for any particular query.\nThis can be applied on a per-field basis.\nThis means that fields in a record can be redacted or masked based on:\n\nthe contents of the record\nthe user accessing the record \nthe contextual information provided by the user or the system at the time of the query.\n\nPalisade's aim is to provide a stable framework for enforcing policy and auditing requirements for data access requests, while, at the same time, not limiting the solution to any single platform ecosystem.\nPalisade can be deployed into many different ecosystems such as Hadoop, Kubernetes, AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.\nAs adoption of Palisade grows, then the burden of creating new connectors (between Palisade and new technologies for storing and processing data) can be shared across the community.\n\nIf required, Palisade allows an organisation to use centralised services which each deployment of Palisade's data access services can share.\nThis means that your data access policies, audit logs, user account details etc. don't need to be duplicated on every system.\nOf course, Palisade can still be deployed locally on a per-platform basis.\nAdditional

An issue should relate to a single functional or non-functional change - changes to alter/improve other pieces of functionality should be addressed in a separate issue in order to keep reviews atomic.\nThe reasoning behind code changes should be documented in the GitHub issue. \nAll resolved issues should be included in the next GitHub milestone, this enables releases to be linked to the included issues.\nIf a code change requires users to make changes in order for them to adopt it then the issue should be labelled 'migration-required' and a comment should be added similar to:\n### Migration Steps\n\n[Description of what needs to be done to adopt the code change with examples]\nWorkflow\n\nAssign yourself to the issue\nCreate a new branch off develop using pattern: gh-[issue number]-[issue-title]\nCommit your changes prefixing your commit title with: gh-[issue-number] - [commit title]\nCheck your changes\nCreate a pull request to merge your branch into develop (and assign label in-review to your issue)\nThe pull request will be reviewed and following any changes and approval your branch will be merged into develop\nDelete the branch\nClose the issue - add a comment saying it has been merged into develop\n\nPull Requests\nPull requests will undergo an in depth review by a Palisade committer to check the code changes are compliant with our coding style. This is a community so please be respectful of other members - offer encouragement, support and suggestions. \nAs described in our git branching model - please raise pull requests to merge you changes in our develop branch.\nPlease agree to the GCHQ OSS Contributor License Agreement before submitting a pull request.\nCoding style\nPlease ensure your coding style is consistent with rest of the project and follow coding standards and best practices.\nIn particular please ensure you have adhered to the following:\n\nStrive for small easy to read and understand classes and methods.\nSeparate out related classes into packages and avoid highly coupled classes and modules.\nCheckstyle is run as part of 'mvn package' so you should ensure your code is compliant with these. The project will not build if there are issues which cause these plugins to fail.\nClasses and methods should comply with the single responsibility principal.\nAvoid magic numbers and strings literals.\nAvoid coupling services, if necessary duplicate code so individual services can be updated without causing cascading issues.\nLook after your streams - if you open one make sure you close it too. This should apply to all volatile resource usage.\nDon't swallow exceptions - ensure they are logged or rethrown.\nGive credit for other peoples work.\nUpdate the NOTICES file for changes to the dependencies.\nConsider the scope of dependencies - restrict them when possible using the appropriate maven scope.\nDon't expose private logic in classes through public methods.\nTry to avoid static classes/methods.\nField access should be controlled via getters and setters.\nMake use of the core Java API - don't reinvent the wheel.\nMake use of generic typing.\nMake use of appropriate object oriented design patterns.\nUse Loggers instead of System.out.print and Throwable.printStackTrace.\nEnsure that the toString(), equals() and hashCode() methods are implemented where appropriate.\n\nJavadoc\nEnsure your java code has sufficient javadocs explaining what the section of code does and the intended use of it. Javadocs should be used in addition to clean readable code, it is not an excuse to write lazy code.\nIn particular:\n\nAll public classes (not required for test classes unless an explanation of the testing is required)\npublic methods (not required if the functionality is obvious from the method name)\npublic constants (not required if the constant is obvious from the name)\n\nTests\n\nAll new code should be unit tested. Where this is not possible the code should be invoked and the functionality should be tested in an integration test. In a small number of cases this will not be possible - instead steps to verify the code should be thoroughly documented.\nTests should cover edge cases and exception cases as well as normal expected behavior.\nKeep each test decoupled and don't rely on tests running in a given order - don't save state between tests.\nOverall for a given code change aim to improve the code coverage.\nUnit test classes should test a single class and be named [testClass]Test.\nIntegration test classes should be located in the integration tests repository.\nTests should be readable and self documenting where possible. \nEach test should focus on testing one small piece of functionality invoked from a single method call. \nUnit tests should use JUnit 4.x.\nWe suggest the following pattern:\n@Test\npublic void should[DoSomething|ReturnSomething] {\n    // Given\n    [Setup your test here]\n\n    // When\n    [Invoke the test method]\n\n    // Then\n    [assert the method did what was expected]\n}\n\n\n\n"},"doc/initial_requirements.html":{"url":"doc/initial_requirements.html","title":"Initial Requirements","keywords":"","body":"Initial Requirements\nMust have\n\nCan use a data

code\nThe job of the client code is to send the request for data into Palisade and to interpret the result as required for the data processing technology it is written for.\nThe responsibility for implementations of the client code is to provide users with a way to request data from Palisade in a way that the user has to make minimal changes to how they would normally use that processing technology.\nImplementations of this component will usually require deep understanding of the data processing technology in order to best hook into that technology, without needing to fork the code for that technology.\nPalisade Service\nThe palisade service is the main controller of the Palisade system. \nData Service\nThe data service is responsible for validating the requests, gathering the required trusted information from the Palisade service and managing the auditing.\nData Reader\nThe job of the data reader is to read a single resource, de-serialise it into the format that the set of rules for this resource will expect and then apply those rules before passing the data back to the data service.\nThe data reader should also be able to push down filters where appropriate to optimise the read process, e.g. to only retrieve certain columns from a columnar database or a particular row range.\nIt is therefore this component that is unique to each data storage technology.\nAudit Service\nThe audit service is responsible for recording audit logs as requested by other services.\nUser Service\nThe user service is responsible for retrieving details about the user from an authoritative source.\nPolicy Service\nThe job of the policy service is to provide the set of rules (filters or transformations) that need to be applied to each resource that has been requested, based on the user and query context.\nResource Service\nThe job of the resource service is to provide the detailed information about each resource based on a resource id (path/alias) being managed by Palisade.\nThat extra information could be the type of data in that resource, when the resource was created, etc.\nCache Service\nThe job of the cache service is to provide a shared short term cache of the information that a service is going to require which then forwards the data to a backing store to allow for persistence of data and sharing of data between services.\n"},"doc/map_reduce_architecture.html":{"url":"doc/map_reduce_architecture.html","title":"Map Reduce Architecture","keywords":"","body":"High level architecture using a map reduce client\nAn

Request","keywords":"","body":"Standard flow for a read request through the Palisade system\n\n\nThe user makes use of a plug-in (client) for the data processing technology that they are using which makes it almost invisible to them that they are actually querying data via Palisade.\n\nFor a distributed workflow that client code will usually be made up of a driver component and an executor/mapper component.\nThe driver component starts by registering the data request with the palisade service, stating the resources/alias mapping to resources that they want to query,\nalong with a user id and any required context such as a purpose for querying the data.\n\nThe palisade service receives that request then authenticates the user.\n\nThe palisade service then requests the full details about the user from the user service.\n\nThe palisade service then requests from the resource service the mapping of how to connect to the relevant data service(s) to retrieve each of the resources requested.\nThis may allow aliases which map to a list of resources, which would need to be resolved by the resource service.\n\nThe Palisade service requests from the policy service the details of which of the resources the user is allowed to access at a resource level.\n\nThe palisade service then requests from the policy service the record level rules to be applied to each of the resources, passing in the full user details returned by the user service, \nany context passed in by the client code and the list of resources returned by the resource service.\n\nThe palisade service then caches the response from the policy service in the cache service, keyed by a unique token, so that any palisade service can respond to the data server later on.\n\nThe palisade service then returns the token along with the resource to data service connection details mapping of the resources that the user is allowed to access to the client in response to the client registering the request.\n\nThe palisade service will log for auditing that the registration has been successful along with the details of what resources are being approved for the user to read.\n\nThe client code, having received the mapping of resource to data service connection details, can now split the resources up over its executors and then each executor can request each of the resources\nfrom the relevant data service(s).\n\nThe data service receives the request to read a resource.\n\nThe data service then passes that request to the palisade service to authenticate the request and provide the record level rules to be applied to that resource, the user attributes and the context.\n\nThe palisade service responds to the data service by retrieving from the cache service the required details that was previously cached.\n\nThe data service uses the response to read the resource and apply the rules.\n\nThe filtered and transformed data is then streamed back to the client.\n\nThe client then formats the code in the way that the data processing technology expects the data, so the user's code can proceed as if Palisade was never there.\n\nOn close of the data stream the data service will log the completion of the read request.\n\n\n"},"doc/deployment_ideas.html":{"url":"doc/deployment_ideas.html","title":"Deployment Ideas","keywords":"","body":"\nHow might the system be deployed?\nMicro-service deployment using REST APIs\nThis deployment shows how you might have a Palisade service that can use a local audit service component but uses proxies to ask other micro-services for the other information that it requires.\nThose other micro-services could be running on different VMs/machines.\nMonolith deployment\nThis deployment shows that the design works if you want to have all of your services running in the same JVM.\nThis deployment might be useful for instance, in integration test scenarios.\n"},"doc/possible_clients.html":{"url":"doc/possible_clients.html","title":"Possible Clients","keywords":"","body":"Potential Palisade Clients\nThis section gives some insight into how clients could be used as the entry point for users to access data via Palisade.\nReading a stream of data using Apache Spark\nIf you had a data stream in Kafka, you would normally be able to access it using kafka connectors in Java or Python,\nhowever it would not apply the data filtering/transformations that are required by the data policies.\nTherefore, we want to be able to provide the user with as similar an experience as possible so the user hardly realises any difference.\nTo do that we would want the user to start the job off by running the following: \nspark.readStream\n    .option(\"purpose\", \"example purpose\")\n    .format(\"uk.gov.gchq.palisade\")\n    .load(\"data_set\")\n    .select(\"colA\", \"colB\")\n    .show()\n\nWe would expect that Spark would create a filter to be pushed down to the data reader that says it only wants \"colA\" and \"colB\".\nThe Spark client for Palisade would create a user (based on who is running the command) and take the resource, purpose and filter to register a data request with the Palisade service.\nThen the Spark client would then take the response of that request and split the list of resources over the number of executors Spark is running and get each executor to request access to the subset of resources assigned to that executor.\nThe data service receives the request for data and passes that request to the palisade service to validate the request and to get the data access policies that apply to those resources.\nThen the data service can read the resource applying the column selection (columns requested plus any columns required to apply the policy) then apply the policies, transform the data so only the two requested columns are returned and then stream the data back to the executor that made the request.\nThen the Spark client can format the stream of data into a DataFrame so that the standard Spark code can do the rest of the request.\nTherefore as far as the user is concerned they just had to add the option and use the different format, as they would not be able to access the data via any of the other formats.\nThis keeps the API similar to Spark's standard read API. \nUsing the 'cat' command line tool\nIt should be possible to use command line tools like 'cat' to be able to view files that are being protected by Palisade. \nTo do that we would need to write a client that mimics the behaviour of the 'cat' command but routing the request for data via Palisade. \nThen you could alias 'cat' to run that client code. \nTherefore to the end user there is again very little difference to how they would normally use 'cat' if they did not have the data access policy restrictions.\nCreating an S3 client endpoint\nIt should be possible to create an S3 endpoint that allows any out of the box data processing technology that supports S3 to route requests via Palisade. \nThis mechanism would require a way to register your user supplied information such as the purpose for your query to a separate service which provides you a token to embed in the resource URL.\nThen the client would be able to go to strip out the context token and retrieve the contextual information to be used by Palisade.\n"},"doc/security_considerations.html":{"url":"doc/security_considerations.html","title":"Security Considerations","keywords":"","body":"Security considerations\nDuring the architecture of Palisade we spent some time thinking about how we would be able to authenticate who the user is that is requesting access to the data.\nThe security boundaries for Palisade are at the point of contacting each of the different services when deployed as micro services (which is the recommended deployment model).\nFor most services we would only need to authenticate that the processing user that all the services would be running as are the only ones using the public API's.\nThis can be done by packaging a secure key/token/certificate with each of those trusted services and passing that to the other service when making requests, for that service to check that it matches what the service is expecting.\nWhere this gets trickier is when the user is authenticating with one of the palisade services or one of the data service. The main reason this gets tricky is because we expect Palisade to be used to access data in a distributed way over a cluster.\nTherefore the client authentication token is only going to be available on the machine that the client is running the client code on and not necessarily available at the point at which the distributed code is requesting the data from the data services.\nThat is why we have to register the data request with the palisade service first in a non-distributed way where you can provide a personal token/certificate to be validated to ensure authentication.\nThen the palisade service can then provide a token to be passed to the data service to authenticate that the same already authenticated user is requesting access to the desired resource.\nThe data service validates the token with a palisade service and uses it to get the required trusted details from a cache service that is shared by all instances of the palisade service.\nThis is to satisfy Hadoop's security architecture. In environments where users run as themselves (as opposed to everybody running as the Hadoop processing user), we can do client-auth at on connection to the PalisadeService and again at the connection to DataService.\nThe underlying mechanism still works identically, but in addition we can also validate that a user is using the Token assigned to them by the PalisadeService and detect if that Token is being used by a different user (spoofing).  This validation check can not be done with Hadoop.\n"}}}
